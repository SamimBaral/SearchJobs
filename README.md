# SearchJobs
JavaScript, JQuery


This is a partial version of the project that was asked.

Implemtation of more than one search option in a single input field is not done. Also, CSS part is lazy. 

Well, this may be considered as an excuse, anyways I was under an impression that my application was not accepted as I mis-translated the mail with my Finnish skill :). I noticed the mail properly on Sunday around midnight. Meaning, I feel confident that I might have been able to implement the complete solution if I gave it some more time. But I have an important exam this week and considering my workload from other subjects, I cannot find any more time for this project. 

I am also not sure if I understood the question completely and if my solution justifies the requirement. In that case, it may be too much to ask but I would really love the feedback and possibly some model solutions. 

Following is the screenshot of the search result in localhost. I have deployed the application to https://dunnitori.herokuapp.com/

I had a good time doing this project. Thank you.
